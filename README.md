Telebagger is a telegram + discord message scraping program. Which scrapes trading signals from various groups, and simulates their profit/loss outcomes.

The results are automatically stored in a firebase database and some groups are publically displayed on https://telebagger.netlify.app/

Telebagger is written in python and hosted using the heroku webservice.

Telebagger can also perform real trades for anyone with a valid trading account at binance.com, by connecting to the Binance API by changing the environment variables to your own.
